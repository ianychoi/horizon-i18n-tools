propose-trans.sh
----------------

A script to download Zanata translations and prepare a patch for
stable branches.

Usage:

    $ ~/horizon-i18n-tools/propose-trans.sh -h
    Usage: /home/ubuntu/horizon-i18n-tools/propose-trans.sh [options]
    
    Options:
      -r RELEASE : Specify release name in lower case (e.g. juno, icehouse, ...)
                   (Default: juno)
      -b BRANCH  : Specify a target branch name.
                   If unspecified, it will be stable/RELEASE.
                   (Default: )
      -d WORKDIR : Horizon working git repo (Default: /home/ubuntu/horizon)
      -m THRESH  : Minimum percentage of a translation (Default: 95)

Example:

    ~/horizon-i18n-tools/propose-trans.sh -r juno -m 85
    ~/horizon-i18n-tools/propose-trans.sh -r icehouse

$HOME/horizon is used as a working directory by default.

The script does the following:

* Download up-to-date translations from Zanata with the specified progress
  (the default is 95%).
* Check if all of Horizon django.po, djangojs.po and OpenStack Dashboard django.po
  meet the specified progress. If not, remove such languages.
* Exclude files where the only things which have changed are
  the creation date, the version number, the revision date,
  comment lines, or diff file information.
* Update POT files.
* Compile message catalogs if necessary (Icehouse release is shipped with mo files).

You need to do the following manually.

* Update LANGUAGES settings in ``openstack_dashboard/settings.py``
* Prepare the commit itself (``git commit``)

import-trans.sh

the Horizon repository is expected to be in /opt/stack/horizon.

* Download up-to-date translations from Zanata with >=30% progress
* Compile message catalogs
* Update LANGUAGES settings in Horizon ``openstack_dashboard/settings.py``
